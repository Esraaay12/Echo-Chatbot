And it keeps running until a specific phrase is received from the user.

Attention: While ChatterBot is still a popular open source solution for building a chatbot in Python, it hasn’t been actively maintained for a while and has therefore accumulated a significant number of issues.
There are multiple forks of the project that implement fixes and updates to the existing codebase, but you’ll have to personally pick the fork that implements the solution you’re looking for and then install it directly from GitHub. A fork might also come with additional installation instructions.
